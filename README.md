# Authsphere üëã

Authsphere is an open-source authentication and authorization service that provides a range of features similar to Auth0. It offers token authentication, email and password authentication, multi-factor authentication (MFA), JWT and refresh token management, role-based access control (RBAC), a dashboard for managing the authentication service, user and user session management, and provides SDKs and APIs for seamless integration.

## Features

- Token Authentication: Authenticate users using tokens for secure access to protected resources.
- Email and Password Authentication: Allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts using email and password credentials.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enhance security with additional verification layers such as SMS codes, email verification, or authenticator apps.
- JWT and Refresh Token Management: Generate and manage JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for secure communication, with refresh tokens to extend access without reauthentication.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assign roles and permissions to users for fine-grained access control.
- Dashboard: A user-friendly dashboard interface for managing the authentication service, including configuration settings, user management, and user session tracking.
- User and User Session Management: Provide functionality to manage user accounts and track user sessions.
- SDKs and APIs: Simplify integration with SDKs and APIs for easy implementation in various applications.
- Boilerplate: Provides a standardized code structure and project foundation for easier development with go fibre can be altered as you wish.
- Devices Auth: Enables authentication and management of user devices to enhance security.
- MFA: Integration with multi-factor authentication methods to add an extra layer of user verification.
- Passwordless Signup (TBD): Optional feature that allows users to sign up without passwords, utilizing alternative methods like email verification or social sign-in.
- Social Signup: Integration with popular social media platforms for seamless user sign-up and login.
- Sending Out Notifications: Capability to send out notifications to users, such as account verification emails or password reset instructions.



## Built With

- Go: Backend development language for building the authentication service.
- Fiber: Lightweight web framework in Go for efficient routing and handling HTTP requests.
- SQLite (Optional): Default database choice for storing user and session data. It can be swapped with other databases based on your requirements.
- Svelte: Frontend framework for building the dashboard interface with its reactive and component-based approach.
